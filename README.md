# Typing Test Web App
Java, HTML, Spring-Boot, Maven

This is a **Typing Speed Test** web application that allows users to test their typing skills by typing a random sentence within a given time frame. The app calculates and displays the **WPM**, **CPM**, and **accuracy** of the user in real-time.

## Features
- **Dynamic text rendering**: Displays random text for the user to type.
- **Real-time score display**: Shows words per minute, characters per minute and accuracy as you type.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Dependency Management**: Maven

## Project Setup
1. Navigate to repository on terminal by: cd typing-test
2. Ensure Maven and Spring-Boot installed to build and run the project then type: mvn clean install
3. Run the Spring-Boot app: mvn spring-boot:run

## What I Worked On
Developed the core typing test logic using JavaScript.
Collaborated with teammates who worked on Spring Boot and Maven; observed how the backend and dependency management were handled.

## Learning Areas
Got exposure to how Spring Boot and Maven are used in real projects, though Iâ€™m still in the early stages of learning them.
Currently exploring backend frameworks and tools like Maven to better understand how they support full-stack development.
