# Typing Test Web App
Java, HTML, Spring-Boot, Maven

This is a **Typing Speed Test** web application that allows users to test their typing skills by typing a random sentence within a given time frame. The app calculates and displays the **WPM**, **CPM**, and **accuracy** of the user in real-time.

## Features
- **Dynamic text rendering**: Displays random text for the user to type.
- **Real-time score display**: Shows words per minute, characters per minute and accuracy as you type.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Dependency Management**: Maven

## Project Setup
1. Navigate to repository on terminal by: cd typing-test
2. Ensure Maven and Spring-Boot installed to build and run the project then type: mvn clean install
3. Run the Spring-Boot app: mvn spring-boot:run

## What I Worked On
Developed the core typing test logic using JavaScript.
Assisted with the Spring Boot integration and Maven setup for managing project dependencies and running the application.

## Learning Areas
While I had prior experience with Java, I learned the basics of Spring Boot and Maven during the project.
Currently working on improving my understanding of backend frameworks and dependency management.
